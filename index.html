    <h1>Lockheed blackbird</h1>
    <h2>SR-71</h2>
    <p><i>The Lockheed SR-71 "Blackbird" is a long-range, high-altitude, Mach 3+ strategic reconnaissance aircraft developed 
        and manufactured by the American aerospace company Lockheed Corporation. 
        It was operated by both the United States Air Force (USAF) and NASA</i></p>

    <p>The SR-71 was developed as a black project from the Lockheed A-12 reconnaissance aircraft during the 1960s by Lockheed's 
        Skunk Works division. American aerospace engineer Clarence "Kelly" Johnson was responsible for many of the aircraft's 
        innovative concepts. The shape of the SR-71 was based on that of the A-12, which was one of the first aircraft to be 
        designed with a reduced radar cross-section. At one point, a bomber variant of the aircraft was under consideration, 
        before the program was focused solely on reconnaissance. Mission equipment for the reconnaissance role included signals 
        intelligence sensors, a side-looking airborne radar, and a photo camera; the SR-71 was both longer and heavier than the
         A-12, allowing it to hold more fuel as well as a two-seat cockpit. The SR-71 designation has been attributed to lobbying 
         efforts by USAF Chief of Staff General Curtis LeMay, who preferred the SR (Strategic Reconnaissance) designation over simply
          RS (Reconnaissance, Strategic). 
        The aircraft was introduced to operational service in January 1966.</p>
